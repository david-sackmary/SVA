# Autoupdate.rb Searches our current CSV for 'noadv' and 'truepos' rows which can be
# updated to 'patched' based on data from the new pull.
#
# Inputs all rows from Oval which have been classified as 'patched'.
# Inputs our current CSV.
# Output our current CSV, identical except for rows matching the criteria.
#
# The criteria for a match is rows in out current CSV must have 'noadv' or 'truepos' status,
# and the same major version, architecture, package and CVE as the row from the
# most recent pull.
#
# The only fields we update in case of a match are:
# 'status','minfixver', and notes.
#
# Input:    CSV from git.
# Input:    CSV file of patched rows.
# Output:   CSV from git with patch updates.
# Output:   Changelog.
#
# TESTING (files are in git):
#
# To perform these tests, Cut and Paste the command lines below:
#
# Proving it does what it says:
#   ruby autopatch.rb  autopatch_test1.csv test_patches.csv autopatch_test1_out.csv autopatch_test1_changelog.csv
#   diff autopatch_test1.csv autopatch_test1_out.csv  #shows that 5 rows of 'noadv' are now 'patched'
#   cat test1_changelog.csv                           #shows original row followed by modified row
#
# Proving it does not modify anything else:
#   ruby autopatch.rb  autopatch_test2.csv test_patches.csv autopatch_test2_out.csv autopatch_test2_changelog.csv
#   diff autopatch_test2.csv autopatch_test2_out.csv  #shows that input is identical to output
#   cat test2_changelog.csv                           #blank, showing nothing changed
#
# Proving that it does both when the above test cases are intermingled:
#   ruby autopatch.rb  autopatch_test3.csv test_patches.csv autopatch_test3_out.csv autopatch_test3_changelog.csv
#   diff autopatch_test3.csv autopatch_test3_out.csv  #shows that 5 rows of 'noadv' are now 'patched'
#   diff test1_changelog.csv test3_changelog.csv      #diff against 1st changelog, an identical diff proves only the rows expected to change have changed.

### Convert belowfrom Python:
#
# Verify that the number of lines of input matches the number of lines of output:
#
# num_lines_in   = sum(1 for line in open(sys.argv[2]))
# num_lines_out  = sum(1 for line in open(sys.argv[3]))
# if (num_lines_in == num_lines_out):
#   print "Autopatch.py PASS: input %d lines, output %d lines" % (num_lines_in, num_lines_out)
# else
#   sys.exit("Autopatch.py FAIL: input %d lines, output %d lines" % (num_lines_in, num_lines_out))
